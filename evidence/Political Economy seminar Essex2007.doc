Dear Eric,

I have now spoken with my colleagues, and they would be happy to have
you come give a talk in the political economy series. Could you contact
the organizer Thomas Plumper (cc'ed on this message) on possible dates
for next year?

I am afraid we do not have many resources for bringing in external
speakers. If you are in Spain then we may be able to cover the cost of
airfare if you can find a flight on a budget airline (though Thomas
would have to agree to this). EasyJet flies from several cities in Spain
to London-Stansted, which is very close to us. We probably would not
have any funds for overnight accommodation, but you are welcome to stay
with me if you would like to stay overnight here.

best wishes,
Kristian

Dear all, we have two possible dates in February: 05.02. and 19.02.
We have not yet decided whether we want to carry on with the workshop in
the summer term. If so, we have two additional dates. If this all is
inconvenient, we have the autumn 2007. But it is too early to make
arrangements for the autumn 07 term.
And yes, we do have money for flights from Spain.

Best
Thomas
